## Space USE 2.0
SpaceUse is an open-source web application that can be used to collect data on how user/customers use a particular area, floor, room or building with ease. It was designed to streamline the process of collecting and calculating data on customers actions while using a specific facility. We designed SpaceUse to work across different browser as well as on touch screen devices.

SpaceUse has the ability to compile all the data that gets collected in an easily readable fashion, whether that is in text format or visually on a map of the specific area. Users of SpaceUse have the ability to add new floor plans, add new activities for the furniture, add new layouts for each floor plan and more. 

## Getting Started
SpaceUse was developed using Electron, a Node.js platform that allows for converstion of HTML and Javascript interfaces into executable files.
